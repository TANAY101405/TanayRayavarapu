# Study Plan

4/18: Watch Collegeboard Videos on earlier Units and polish Create Task during class; At home, go through AP preparation book and start diving deep into the content for review purposes (Binary Digits + Ascii and Decimal Values and more math focused review)

4/19: Complete Quiz 1 during class and reflect on how I did and what I can improve on; Complete more AP Preperation at home

4/20: Work on learning more content surrounding computing bias and digital divide 

4/21: Complete Quiz 2 during class and work on corrections to see if I improved from the first quiz (around the same); then, focus on those missed questions to review over the weekend

4/22: Finalize Create Task and work on crossover review with someone else more experienced to see if it meets requirements or needs improvement

Review Comments:
- Looks well done and meets the collegeboard Create Task Requirements
- Is fully functional as can be seen in the runtime
- Video is 1 minute long and displays all the features of the program
- Write-up is descriptive, but can be improved in pointing to specific examples within the code
- Can design the program to look more appealing if that is a topic of interest for Tanay
