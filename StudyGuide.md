# Study Plan

## Week 7

4/25: Work throughout week on finishing up Create Task touches

4/26: Complete Quiz 3 MCQ and reflect on possible improvements/declines from last week

4/27: Work more on Create Task and get a final review from a crossover grader that can review the code

4/28: Work on Quiz 3 MCQ corrections and further study the topics that I need to improve on

4/29: Revise write-up and possible re-record video to match new changes to Create Task; submit over weekend

### Quiz Scores and Corrections

Finals Quiz| Score | 
----- | ----- | 
Quiz 3 | 45/50 | 


### MCQ 3: 45/50

Question Number| What was the mistake and what is right | Area of Review | 
----- | ----- | ----- |
 Q2 | Not all solutions can be solved algorithmically, even if the files are large. Therefore the answer is D. |  Investigate the situation, context, or task  | 
 Q6 | The answer is not C because the number 20 isn't counted in the alogorithm. As soon as x becomes 20, the algorithm terminates |  Represent algorithmic processes without using a programming language.  | 
 Q7 | The error will not terminate and return with a value. In each subsequent iteration of the loop, the value of j increases until it exceeds n. Then, the program will stop.  |  Determine the result of code segments.  |
 Q13 | Have to add initial 25 * 5 dollars to the value after the first 25 units |  Implement and apply an algorithm  | 
 Q44 | Generalizes the square and cube functions to 'power', not add. Therefore, it does n to the power of m. |  Explain how abstraction manages complexity.  |

## Week 6

4/18: Watch Collegeboard Videos on earlier Units and polish Create Task during class; At home, go through AP preparation book and start diving deep into the content for review purposes (Binary Digits + Ascii and Decimal Values and more math focused review)

4/19: Complete Quiz 1 during class and reflect on how I did and what I can improve on; Complete more AP Preperation at home

4/20: Work on learning more content surrounding computing bias and digital divide 

4/21: Complete Quiz 2 during class and work on corrections to see if I improved from the first quiz (around the same); then, focus on those missed questions to review over the weekend

4/22: Finalize Create Task and work on crossover review with someone else more experienced to see if it meets requirements or needs improvement

 Q23 | While the IP Address from a user's computer gives some information to the Internet, it does not provide much more personal information. In fact, cookies help websites learn more about users that visited them |  Impact of Gathering Data  | 
 Q42 | The next decimal value will go to 2^2 as it is after 2^1 + 2^0. Therefore, the answer is A: 1001 0100 |  Binary Implementation in Algorithms  | 
 
 ### MCQ 2: 47/50

Question Number| What was the mistake and what is right | Area of Review | 
----- | ----- | ----- |
 Q32 | 4 bits are enough to store 16 pieces of information, so you do not need extra bits | Binary and Solving | 
 Q35 | Integers are not subject to rounding errors because you cannot approximate them. However, the sum would cause an overflow error because it exceeds the amount of bits | Binary and Solving | 
 Q42 | Cloud Computing needs redundancy, doesn't eliminate it. In fact, it works to help users collaborate and protect private information | Impact of a computing Innovation  |

Reviewed by: Arnav Palkhiwala 

Review Comments:
- Looks well done and meets the collegeboard Create Task Requirements
- Is fully functional as can be seen in the runtime
- Video is 1 minute long and displays all the features of the program
- Write-up is descriptive, but can be improved in pointing to specific examples within the code
- Can design the program to look more appealing if that is a topic of interest for Tanay
