### What can I do with tech to improve mine or othersâ€™ educations?

Technology is an integral part of our lives, especially education. In the past couple decades, technology has become more and more tied to the learning achieved by new generations. Due to the pandemic in 2020, all the schools and universities around the world shut down and went online for a whole year. This is a prime example of how technology has helped people stay communicated and better their education. Without tech, we wouldn't be able to learn the next year's curriculum and be prepared to graduate. One way I can use to tech to improve education is by creating informational websites that can help people develop their skills from the comfort of their homes. Who wouldn't want to better themselves from the leisure of their living room couch? We have seen websites like Khan Academy blossom because they have a wide library of educational videos followed up by practices that help people master skills in certain subjects. Technology is a worldwide outlet, so taking advantage of it to improve our educations is crucial.
