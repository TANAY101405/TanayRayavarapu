## 5.4: Crowdsourcing
- A crowdsourcing idea for our CompSci class would be to have everyone try to learn a new instrument. One thing the entire department has in common is experience with computer science and programming. Since there would less bias towards an instrument, it would be easier to ask everyone to learn a new instrument. Initiating it in the environment would require us to However, some people in CompSci already know how to play an instrument, which shows that crowdsourcing can reach other areas within a specific field. Del Norte Crowdsourcing is harder than for CompSci because there are so many people with different backgrounds. In computer science, we all that in commmon. However, people all over the school have interests in their own thing,so our final project would be better would crowdsourcing. We can gather data from everyone and have them try to learn programming and develop their skills in it.

## 5.3: Computing Bias

Even though it was a big mistake, I do not believe that the owners of the HP computer company are racist. They just had a lack of diversity when creating the feature. It was not in their intention to rule out people with darker skin, but when creating the software, they only geared it towards people with lighter skin because they probably did not have all racial perspectives (the development team lacked diversity and inclusion). Even though it is harmful, it was not intentional. I believe that the mistake should be corrected because the feature excludes a lot of people from participating it. It was a flaw on the development team's side, so it is their responsibility to fix it and make it accessible for everyone.


## 5.2 Github Actions: Digital Empowerment and Divide
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- Someone empowers themselves digitally by constantly trying to learn and improve their digital skills. For example, a majority of the population use technology on a day-to-day basis. However, how many of those people know what is actually going on to enable them to use the technology. Being able to learn those skills and replicate human creation digitally is very important for the future. A digital world revolves around technology, so it is important and empowering to know how to use it properly.

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
- If someone is not empowered, it most likely means that they do not have access to technology or just not interested in immersing themselves in the digital world. One way that we could fix this at Del Norte is by providing everyone with a piece of equipment that is not fully restricted but monitors any unsafe and harmful actions. 

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Paper is an alternative form to digital education, so in a way, it is hindering digital empowerment. At our school, we do not have many barriers to digital education since a majority of curriculum's are now mostly online, and only use paper during things like tests. Elsewhere, I know that many schools do not have enough money to afford a fully digital education, or they are too restrictive on using technology. 

## 5.1: Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

Beneficial: Firstly, computers can store endless amounts of information and can help reduce the wastage of natural resources that goes into the production of paper, books, supplies. Secondly, computing connects users with millions of people across the internet through messages, social media, and more. This used to not be possible without the development of technology and computer automation. Thirdly, the internet allows us to stay notified and informed about important things happening around the world (ie. a war, pandemic, earthquake).
Harmful: Firstly, too much use of technology can make you addicted to unrealistic things without experiencing proper social interactions that are crucial. Secondly, computing and the distribution of private information online is a prominent issue in our world and is very hard to prevent. Lastly, a heavy reliance on technology and computing can remove the need to do things individually as we now rely on something other than ourselves.


Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?


Answer: Dopamine issues are where you are too addicted to doing something to the point where you rely on the pleasure it gives rather than its harmful consequences. For example, I have fallen into the trap of playing video games and watching YouTube instead of preparing for school because of the pleasure I received in the moment from the release of dopamine. It can effect school and physical performance if that is the only thing you focus on.
