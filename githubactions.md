# Github Actions

## 5.1 Github Actions: 
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

Beneficial: Firstly, computers can store endless amounts of information and can help reduce the wastage of natural resources that goes into the production of paper, books, supplies. Secondly, computing connects users with millions of people across the internet through messages, social media, and more. This used to not be possible without the development of technology and computer automation. Thirdly, the internet allows us to stay notified and informed about important things happening around the world (ie. a war, pandemic, earthquake).
Harmful: Firstly, too much use of technology can make you addicted to unrealistic things without experiencing proper social interactions that are crucial. Secondly, computing and the distribution of private information online is a prominent issue in our world and is very hard to prevent. Lastly, a heavy reliance on technology and computing can remove the need to do things individually as we now rely on something other than ourselves.


Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?


Answer: Dopamine issues are where you are too addicted to doing something to the point where you rely on the pleasure it gives rather than its harmful consequences. For example, I have fallen into the trap of playing video games and watching YouTube instead of preparing for school because of the pleasure I received in the moment from the release of dopamine. It can effect school and physical performance if that is the only thing you focus on.


## 5.2 Github Actions: Digital Empowerment
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- Someone empowers themselves digitally by constantly trying to learn and improve their digital skills. For example, a majority of the population use technology on a day-to-day basis. However, how many of those people know what is actually going on to enable them to use the technology. Being able to learn those skills and replicate human creation digitally is very important for the future. A digital world revolves around technology, so it is important and empowering to know how to use it properly.

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
- If someone is not empowered, it most likely means that they do not have access to technology or just not interested in immersing themselves in the digital world. One way that we could fix this at Del Norte is by providing everyone with a piece of equipment that is not fully restricted but monitors any unsafe and harmful actions. 

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Paper is an alternative form to digital education, so in a way, it is hindering digital empowerment. At our school, we do not have many barriers to digital education since a majority of curriculum's are now mostly online, and only use paper during things like tests. Elsewhere, I know that many schools do not have enough money to afford a fully digital education, or they are too restrictive on using technology.
