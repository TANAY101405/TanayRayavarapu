## 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns
Intellectual property (IP)
- A work or invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights

Copyright
- Protects IP and keeps anyone from using it
- Plagiarism: Presenting material as your own
- Legal ways to use material
- Creative Commons
- Open source
- Open access

Open source
- Programs made freely available for anyone to use and may be redistributed and modified

Open Access
- Online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
Digital Divide: Unequal distribution of access to technology


## 5.6 Safe Computing
Personally Identifiable information (PII): Information specific to individual
- Social security number
- Age
- Race
- Phone #
- Date of birth
- Email address
- Mailing address
- Can be used to steal someone’s data
- Search engines maintain our search history
- Used to enhance a user’s online experience
- Can be exploited if protections are ignored

- Google, Facebook, and Twitter gather lots of information based on what you search and post
- Lots of risks to privacy as your activity is recorded and kept in data
- Information put on the internet does not go away
- Internet is an integral part of our lives

Phishing:
- An attempt to trick a user into providing personal information, like usernames and passwords
- Phising emails look like they are from a company that you know
- Bank
- Credit card company
- Social networking site
- Video streaming service
- Online Store
- Click on a link or opening an attachment
Clicking on a link or opening an attachment can install a virus or a bad website

Keylogger:
- Records every keystroke made by a user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords or other confidential information

Rogue Access Point: A wireless network that can give unauthorized access to secure networks
- Authentication measures are strong passwords and multi-factor authentication
- Protects devices and information from unauthorized access
- Create strong passwords have requirements to make them more complex/secure
- Multi-factor authentication: what you know, what you are, what you have
- Virus and malware can get access to systems and affect it

Asymmetric encryption:
- Public key for encrypting
- Private key for decrypting


## 5.1 Github Actions: 
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

Beneficial: Firstly, computers can store endless amounts of information and can help reduce the wastage of natural resources that goes into the production of paper, books, supplies. Secondly, computing connects users with millions of people across the internet through messages, social media, and more. This used to not be possible without the development of technology and computer automation. Thirdly, the internet allows us to stay notified and informed about important things happening around the world (ie. a war, pandemic, earthquake).
Harmful: Firstly, too much use of technology can make you addicted to unrealistic things without experiencing proper social interactions that are crucial. Secondly, computing and the distribution of private information online is a prominent issue in our world and is very hard to prevent. Lastly, a heavy reliance on technology and computing can remove the need to do things individually as we now rely on something other than ourselves.


Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?


Answer: Dopamine issues are where you are too addicted to doing something to the point where you rely on the pleasure it gives rather than its harmful consequences. For example, I have fallen into the trap of playing video games and watching YouTube instead of preparing for school because of the pleasure I received in the moment from the release of dopamine. It can effect school and physical performance if that is the only thing you focus on.


## 5.2 Github Actions: Digital Empowerment
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- Someone empowers themselves digitally by constantly trying to learn and improve their digital skills. For example, a majority of the population use technology on a day-to-day basis. However, how many of those people know what is actually going on to enable them to use the technology. Being able to learn those skills and replicate human creation digitally is very important for the future. A digital world revolves around technology, so it is important and empowering to know how to use it properly.

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
- If someone is not empowered, it most likely means that they do not have access to technology or just not interested in immersing themselves in the digital world. One way that we could fix this at Del Norte is by providing everyone with a piece of equipment that is not fully restricted but monitors any unsafe and harmful actions. 

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Paper is an alternative form to digital education, so in a way, it is hindering digital empowerment. At our school, we do not have many barriers to digital education since a majority of curriculum's are now mostly online, and only use paper during things like tests. Elsewhere, I know that many schools do not have enough money to afford a fully digital education, or they are too restrictive on using technology.
