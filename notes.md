- Algorithm
- Metadata write in

Crowdfunding:
- Kickstarter
- IndieGoGo

- BlockChain


## 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns
Intellectual property (IP)
- A work or invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights

Copyright
- Protects IP and keeps anyone from using it
- Plagiarism: Presenting material as your own

Open source
- Programs made freely available for anyone to use and may be redistributed and modified

Open Access
- Online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
Digital Divide: Unequal distribution of access to technology


## 5.6 Safe Computing
Personally Identifiable information (PII): Information specific to individual
- Social security number
- Age
- Race
- Phone #
- Date of birth
- Email address
- Mailing address
- Can be used to steal someone’s data
- Search engines maintain our search history
- Used to enhance a user’s online experience
- Can be exploited if protections are ignored

- Google, Facebook, and Twitter gather lots of information based on what you search and post
- Lots of risks to privacy as your activity is recorded and kept in data
- Information put on the internet does not go away
- Internet is an integral part of our lives

Keylogger:
- Records every keystroke made by a user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords or other confidential information

Rogue Access Point: A wireless network that can give unauthorized access to secure networks
- Authentication measures are strong passwords and multi-factor authentication
- Protects devices and information from unauthorized access
- Create strong passwords have requirements to make them more complex/secure
- Multi-factor authentication: what you know, what you are, what you have
- Virus and malware can get access to systems and affect it

Asymmetric encryption:
- Public key for encrypting
- Private key for decrypting
